## Abstract
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has shown promise in enabling multimodal large language models to solve complex problems. However, CoT suffers from an over-reliance on textual cues and struggles to adapt general reasoning capabilities to highly specialized domains such as radiology. In this paper, we introduce Anatomy-CoT, a multi-step reasoning framework that follows real-world radiology pedagogical practices and incorporates visual grounding to enhance interpretability for radiologists. Comprehensive evaluations show that Anatomy-CoT delivers transparent reasoning, achieves an 11.7% improvement over vanilla CoT, and generalizes robustly to out-of-domain radiology images.
